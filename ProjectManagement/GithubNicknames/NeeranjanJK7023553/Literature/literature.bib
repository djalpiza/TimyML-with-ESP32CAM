This paper introduces TensorFlow Lite Micro (TF Micro), an open-source ML inference framework for running deep-learning models on embedded systems. Here the framework adopts a unique interpreter-based approach that provides flexibility while overcoming efficiency challenges. This paper explains the design decisions behind TF Micro and describes its implementation details.
